        <p>Bif Goot didn't <em>choose</em> his name — the universe chose it for him. After being mis-typed into existence, he embraced the happy accident and now proudly introduces himself as <strong>"Bif!</strong></p>

        <p>Bif is the unofficial guardian of the mossy forests around Cryptid Quest. He tends to appear at the edges of campfires, just far enough back to stay mysterious, but close enought to listen to the stories. He's a surprisingly thoughtful creature, known for leaving small, stacked rock towers along pathways as a sign he passed through recently.</p>

        <p>Rumor has it Bif loves rhythm and often communicates by tapping patterns on hollow trees. Some cryptid researchers believe he has his own form of forest Morse code.</p>

        <p>Cryptid hunters claim Bif Goot teaches young Sasquatches by rhythm alone, like a heartbeat passed through the trees</p>

        <p>When things get dangerous out in the wilf, Bif is the one you want watching your back — even if you don't see him directly.</p>
