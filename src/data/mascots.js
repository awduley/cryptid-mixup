    lore: [
      `Bif Goot didn't choose his name—the universe chose it for him. After being mis-typed into existence, he embraced the happy accident and now proudly introduces himself as "Bif!"`,

      `Bif is the unofficial guardian of the mossy forests around Cryptid Quest. He tends to appear at the edges of campfires, just far enough back to stay mysterious, but close enough to listen to the stories. He's a surprisingly thoughtful creature, known for leaving small, stacked rock towers along pathways as a sign he passed through recently.`,

      `Rumor has it Bif loves rhythm and often communicates by tapping patterns on hollow trees. Some cryptid researchers believe he has his own form of forest Morse code.`,

      `Cryptid hunters claim Bif Goot teaches young Sasquatches by rhythm alone, like a heartbeat passed through the trees.`,

      `When things get dangerous out in the wild, Bif is the one you want watching your back—even if you never see him directly.`,

    name: "Brutus the Belligerent Beaver",
    slug: "brutus-the-belligerent-beaver",
    tagline: "Ill-tempered, hot-headed, and ready to chew you out.",
    summary:
      "Brutus is a volatile woodland bruiser with a bite to match. Known across Cryptid Quest Woods as the forest's most combative critter, he's the type to chomp first and ask questions never. With an attitude as sharp as his incisors, Brutus is always one snapped twig away from a full-blown meltdown.",

    // Paragraph-style lore for the detail page
    lore: [
      `Nobody truly knows why Brutus behaves the way he does. He's arrogant, narcissistic, argumentative, and quite toxic—think “walking red flag,” but furrier. If it moves, he argues with it. If it doesn't move, he argues with it anyway. He seems to enjoy being mad; living in a constant simmering rage is basically his emotional comfort zone. His vocabulary of insults is legendary, spanning three biomes and at least one made-up language.`,

      `Unfortunately for Brutus, his overconfidence is both his greatest motivator and his biggest downfall. His delusions of genius leave him easily manipulated by creatures clever enough to flatter him. Cryptid historians note numerous incidents of Brutus being tricked into doing someone else's dirty work simply because they told him he was “the only beaver smart enough for the job.” He's not even close — he's about twelve cans short of a six-pack.`,
      
      `But what Brutus lacks in mental acuity, he more than makes up for in raw engineering talent. He skyrocketed to beaverdom fame after building a legendary lodge at the lake behind Cryptid Quest Woods — a masterpiece of timber architecture so impressive that even rival beavers had to admit:
      “Okay… yeah. That's actually pretty fire.”
      For a moment, Brutus even experienced peace. A very short moment.`,

  name: "Dredsky",
  slug: "dredsky",
  tagline: "Smells like low tide... must be showtime.",

  summary:
    "Dredsky (pronounced dread-skee) never intended to be called Dredsky. His real name was Dredseksy—because honestly, look at him, he's a devastatingly handsome undead. But after a chaotic dungeon brawl in a great hall, a groupmate kept shouting 'Dredsky!' by mistake… and the name stuck harder than rigor mortis. Now, even he uses it.",

  lore: [
    `When he's not donning his battered metal armor and tanking for anyone brave (or foolish) enough to venture into the Cryptid Quest Woods, Dredsky can almost always be found shredding on his blackened V-shaped guitar, which he affectionately calls "Frostbite." The icy blue runes he carved into it pulse with faint energy—maybe magic, maybe attitude.`,

    `Because of his undead nature, most assume he's something to fear. He does look intimidating, with that permanent scowl and deep gravelly voice that sounds like it crawled out of a crypt at sunrise. But in truth, he's humble, respectful, and surprisingly easy to talk to. Dredsky is the first to help when someone's in trouble—though his voice tends to make the offer sound like a threat.`,

    `As for where he comes from, even Dredsky isn't entirely sure. Being dead really messes with your memory. His Nordic-style clothing and the runes etched into Frostbite suggest a northern origin… yet sometimes, in the quiet moments between riffs, he recalls a fog-shrouded place called Silverpine Forest. Whether that memory is real or just undead brain static is anyone's guess.`
