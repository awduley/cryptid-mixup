    lore: [
      `Bif Goot didn't choose his name—the universe chose it for him. After being mis-typed into existence, he embraced the happy accident and now proudly introduces himself as "Bif!"`,

      `Bif is the unofficial guardian of the mossy forests around Cryptid Quest. He tends to appear at the edges of campfires, just far enough back to stay mysterious, but close enough to listen to the stories. He's a surprisingly thoughtful creature, known for leaving small, stacked rock towers along pathways as a sign he passed through recently.`,

      `Rumor has it Bif loves rhythm and often communicates by tapping patterns on hollow trees. Some cryptid researchers believe he has his own form of forest Morse code.`,

      `Cryptid hunters claim Bif Goot teaches young Sasquatches by rhythm alone, like a heartbeat passed through the trees.`,

      `When things get dangerous out in the wild, Bif is the one you want watching your back—even if you never see him directly.`,

    summary:
      "Brutus is a volatile woodland bruiser with a bite to match. Known across Cryptid Quest Woods as the forest's most combative critter, he's the type to chomp first and ask questions never. With an attitude as sharp as his incisors, Brutus is always one snapped twig away from a full-blown meltdown.",

    // Paragraph-style lore for the detail page
    lore: [
      `Nobody truly knows why Brutus behaves the way he does. He's arrogant, narcissistic, argumentative, and quite toxic—think “walking red flag,” but furrier. If it moves, he argues with it. If it doesn't move, he argues with it anyway. He seems to enjoy being mad; living in a constant simmering rage is basically his emotional comfort zone. His vocabulary of insults is legendary, spanning three biomes and at least one made-up language.`,

      `Unfortunately for Brutus, his overconfidence is both his greatest motivator and his biggest downfall. His delusions of genius leave him easily manipulated by creatures clever enough to flatter him. Cryptid historians note numerous incidents of Brutus being tricked into doing someone else's dirty work simply because they told him he was “the only beaver smart enough for the job.” He's not even close — he's about twelve cans short of a six-pack.`,
      
      `But what Brutus lacks in mental acuity, he more than makes up for in raw engineering talent. He skyrocketed to beaverdom fame after building a legendary lodge at the lake behind Cryptid Quest Woods — a masterpiece of timber architecture so impressive that even rival beavers had to admit:
      “Okay… yeah. That's actually pretty fire.”
      For a moment, Brutus even experienced peace. A very short moment.`,

  summary:
    "Dredsky (pronounced dread-skee) never intended to be called Dredsky. His real name was Dredseksy—because honestly, look at him, he's a devastatingly handsome undead. But after a chaotic dungeon brawl in a great hall, a groupmate kept shouting 'Dredsky!' by mistake… and the name stuck harder than rigor mortis. Now, even he uses it.",

  lore: [
    `When he's not donning his battered metal armor and tanking for anyone brave (or foolish) enough to venture into the Cryptid Quest Woods, Dredsky can almost always be found shredding on his blackened V-shaped guitar, which he affectionately calls "Frostbite." The icy blue runes he carved into it pulse with faint energy—maybe magic, maybe attitude.`,

    `Because of his undead nature, most assume he's something to fear. He does look intimidating, with that permanent scowl and deep gravelly voice that sounds like it crawled out of a crypt at sunrise. But in truth, he's humble, respectful, and surprisingly easy to talk to. Dredsky is the first to help when someone's in trouble—though his voice tends to make the offer sound like a threat.`,

    `As for where he comes from, even Dredsky isn't entirely sure. Being dead really messes with your memory. His Nordic-style clothing and the runes etched into Frostbite suggest a northern origin… yet sometimes, in the quiet moments between riffs, he recalls a fog-shrouded place called Silverpine Forest. Whether that memory is real or just undead brain static is anyone's guess.`

    "From Fogwater Coast to forest stages, this ocean-born Selkie was drawn upriver by the distant thrum of a music she’d never known before.",

  summary:
    "Born of fog and tide on the distant Fogwater Coast of the far North, Maerith entrusted her seal-skin to her beloved brother and set out upriver in search of something she could not yet name—an ache of curiosity and calling that even the sea herself could not soothe. Days into her journey, she heard the distant thrum of drums and chords rising through the forest and followed the sound to its source. Soft-spoken and serene, she brings a traveler’s grace to the merch table and serves as the warm, welcoming face of the band across the Northern Fringe’s social circles. Though she traded beaches for forest paths, she still carries the quiet magic of the sea with her.",

  lore: [
    `Maerith was born along the mist-heavy shores of Fogwater Coast, where Selkie stories drift like sea-spray between stones. Though she loved the tide’s quiet pull and the familiar rhythm of the waves, she carried a restless curiosity beneath her calm exterior—an ache that whispered of something more than the ocean’s embrace. Trusting her beloved brother with her seal-skin for safekeeping, she left the shoreline willingly, choosing curiosity over certainty as she slipped into the river currents that wound inland toward the heart of the Northern Fringe.`,

    `Her journey upriver was long and wandering, guided by no map or destination—only the quiet instinct that something awaited her beyond the reach of tide and fog. Days grew into weeks as she followed lakes, streams, and forested bends, gathering small tokens along the way: polished river stones, shards of lake-glass, beads carved from driftwood. Then, one evening, as moonlight scattered across a calm stretch of water, she heard it—distant drums, deep and steady, pulsing through the valley like a heartbeat she had never known. Entranced, she followed the rhythm into Cryptid Quest Woods, drawn as surely as the tide is drawn to the moon.`,

    `There she found the band—cryptids and creatures of the forest gathered in a circle of light and sound—and felt at once that she had discovered the thing she had been traveling toward all along. Welcomed with warmth, Maerith became the band’s gentle anchor for fans across the Northern Fringe, tending the merch table with a tide-born calm and serving as the group’s trusted social voice. Though she still carries the sea’s quiet magic, she has woven herself seamlessly into forest life, finding in the band a new family whose music continues to call to her like distant waves.`

  tagline: "A quiet giant rooted deep in the old woods, where moss and stone shape his rhythm.",

  summary:
    "Stoneblood is an ancient forest troll from the Northern Fringe, wandering its deep woods with the quiet strength of moss-covered stone and towering pines. Known for his calm presence, deep connection to the ancient woods, and basslines that echo the steady rhythm of the forest, he serves as the grounding force of the crew.",

  lore: [
    `Old stories from the Northern Fringe speak of a forest troll who has walked the same winding paths for centuries, leaving footprints that fill with moss instead of mud. That troll is Stoneblood. He keeps to the deep woods where the trees grow tallest, moving with a patient, deliberate gait as if he has all the time in the world—because, for him, time has always moved differently. Hunters, loggers, and lost travelers rarely see more than his silhouette between the trunks, but they all remember the feeling that something vast and calm was watching over them, rather than hunting them.`,

    `Stoneblood's rhythm began long before he ever held a bass. As a young troll, he learned to listen to the forest instead of his own footsteps: the slow creak of old pines in the wind, the hollow thud of roots shifting deep beneath the soil, and the sharp crack of stone under winter ice. Those sounds shaped him—not into something sluggish, but into something powerful. When he finally carved a bass from ancient wood and worn metal, its voice echoed everything he had learned: slow when the forest is quiet, heavy when storms roll through, and astonishingly fast when the wild heart of the Fringe surges. His playing carries the full range of nature itself, from stillness to fury.`,

    `Most creatures of the Northern Fringe fear trolls, but Stoneblood is the sort who gains companions instead of trophies. A small Eurasian red squirrel has claimed his shoulder as a favorite perch, riding with him through mist and underbrush as if it were the most natural thing in the world. It was through quiet meetings like these—and a few chance encounters with other wanderers of the woods—that Stoneblood found his way into the wider cryptid company. He does not speak often, but when his bass roars to life, even the bravest cryptids pause, feeling that ancient, grounding rhythm stirring the forest floor beneath their feet.`

  tagline: "A tiny spark of kindness with a talent for big booms.",

  summary:
    "Sparkplug is the Northern Fringe’s most enthusiastic pyro tech, a tiny sable ferret whose kindness is matched only by her accidental explosions. Bright, cheerful, and armed with a spark igniter she probably shouldn’t click so often, she brings unexpected light to every show.",

  lore: [
    `Deep beneath the moss and root-tangles of the Timberfell Basin lies Ironbark Burrows, a winding network of tunnels where mustelid folk have lived for generations. Sparkplug was born there, in a little den warmed by lanternlight and the soft hum of burrow life. Even as a kit, she was known for her bright curiosity—always peeking into toolboxes, following the scent of sap and smoke, and asking a thousand questions in a single breath. The elders often said she didn’t scamper so much as “burst” from place to place, leaving little puffs of dust in her wake.`,

    `Sparkplug’s fascination with sparks began the first time she watched Ironbark engineers test their handmade flare beetles—tiny glowing insects bred to illuminate the tunnels. Her eyes lit up brighter than the beetles themselves. Soon she was tinkering with fuses, wires, and little spark-stones harvested from the basin cliffs. She learned quickly, but she also learned loudly; more than one tunnel ceiling bears a scorch mark shaped suspiciously like the outline of a very small ferret. Yet every mishap came with the same gentle reaction: a soft “Oh dear...” followed by a sincere promise to do better next time.`,

    `Sparkplug wandered west into Cryptid Quest Woods after following the rumble of distant music—something she described as “sounding like thunder that wanted to dance.” She stumbled upon the band’s stage during a late-night rehearsal and offered to “help make the show brighter.” One minor fire and two apologetic squeaks later, the crew realized she had talent… and that nobody else was willing to handle the pyros anyway. Now she is the official pyrotechnics technician, lighting every concert with heart, enthusiasm, and the occasional unexpected boom that sends Brutus ducking, Stoneblood sighing, and Bif Goot cheering because he thought it was part of the song.`
