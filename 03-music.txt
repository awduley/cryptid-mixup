And the Earth Shudders
  1. Intro (name?)

  2. Welcome to the Northern Fringe

    Verse: 
      This Fringe
      Innumerable 
      Immeasurable

      Bastion of 
      the creations relics

      Where we are 
      Born to wonder
      Born to falter
      Born to take a step 
      But never garner hope

    Pre-chorus:
      This realm 
      Whispers of life and death
      Shadows of truth 
      Rarely seen and never understood

    Chorus: 
      Can't you make me understand
      How sake and sanity 
      Goes hand and hand 
      With
