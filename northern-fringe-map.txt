NORTHERN FRINGE — REGIONAL OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------

A vast, diverse northern realm blending deep forests, cold coasts,
fog-drenched valleys, and hidden cryptid territories.

============================================================
CENTRAL REGION — CRYPTID QUEST WOODS
============================================================
• Heart of the Northern Fringe.
• Dense evergreen forests; moss-covered paths; hidden groves.
• Home base of the band and most mascots.
• Contains lake clearings, woodland rivers, and ancient ruins.

Key Locations:
- Band’s rehearsal clearing
- Bif Goot’s drumming grove
- Dredsky’s shadow alcove
- Stoneblood’s forest paths
- Sparkplug’s workshop nook

============================================================
NORTHERN REGION — FOGWATER COAST
============================================================
• Cold, fog-drenched coastline stretching for many miles.
• Birthplace of ocean Selkies.
• Rugged cliffs, driftwood beaches, and moonlit fogbanks.
• Major rivers flow inland from here into the Woods.

Key Features:
- Tideborne river mouths
- Shimmerveil coves
- Selkie gathering stones
- Silverfog inlets

============================================================
EASTERN REGION — TIMBERFELL BASIN
============================================================
• Rolling hills, dense slopes, and burrow networks.
• Moderate climate; perfect for digging and tunneling species.
• Sparkplug’s homeland.

Subregion:
  • Ironbark Burrows  
    - A maze-like system of underground homes inhabited by
      the Ironbark Sable clans (Sparkplug’s people).

============================================================
SOUTHERN REGION — (UNDEFINED YET)
=======
• Reserved for future lore.
• Could house plains cryptids, volcanic terrain, ancient ruins,
  or southern coastal villages depending on future development.

============================================================
WESTERN REGION — (UNDEFINED YET)
============================================================
• Potential home of mountain ranges, deep lakes, giant cryptids,
  or nomadic tribes.

============================================================
ADDITIONAL FUTURE REGIONS
============================================================
• Northeastern Isles  
• Frostback Mountains  
• Moonwake Coast (southern warm region, if ever added)  
• Hollowshade Marshlands  
• STARFELL RIDGE (high-altitude cryptid territory)
• Your imagination will expand these over time.

============================================================
NOTES
============================================================
• Regions connected by river routes, forest paths, and old trade roads.
• The Northern Fringe is intentionally large — travel between
  regions takes days or weeks.
• Each mascot will eventually have a role both in the band and in
  the infrastructure of the Cryptid Quest website.
