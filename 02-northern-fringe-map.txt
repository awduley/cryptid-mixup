NORTHERN FRINGE — REGIONAL OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------

A vast, diverse northern realm blending deep forests, cold coasts,
fog-drenched valleys, and hidden cryptid territories.

============================================================
CENTRAL REGION — CRYPTID QUEST WOODS
============================================================
• Heart of the Northern Fringe.
• Dense evergreen forests; moss-covered paths; hidden groves.
• Home base of the band and most mascots.
• Contains lake clearings, woodland rivers, and ancient ruins.
• The Woods lie in the long shadow of Undergang Fjell to the west.

Key Locations:
- Band’s rehearsal clearing
- Bif Goot’s drumming grove
- Dredsky’s shadow alcove
- Stoneblood’s forest paths
- Sparkplug’s workshop nook
- Old pilgrim trail markers (faded cairns, carved posts, rune-stones)

============================================================
NORTHERN REGION — FOGWATER COAST
============================================================
• Cold, fog-drenched coastline stretching for many miles.
• Birthplace of ocean Selkies.
• Rugged cliffs, driftwood beaches, and moonlit fogbanks.
• Major rivers flow inland from here into the Woods.
• Primary launch-point for the crew’s sailing runs and coastal trouble.

Key Features:
- Tideborne river mouths
- Shimmerveil coves
- Selkie gathering stones
- Silverfog inlets
- Storm-lantern jetties (weathered docks used by fisherfolk and drifters)

============================================================
EASTERN REGION — TIMBERFELL BASIN
============================================================
• Rolling hills, dense slopes, and burrow networks.
• Moderate climate; perfect for digging and tunneling species.
• Sparkplug’s homeland.

Subregion:
  • Ironbark Burrows
    - A maze-like system of underground homes inhabited by
      the Ironbark Sable clans (Sparkplug’s people).

============================================================
WESTERN REGION — UNDERGANG FJELL
============================================================
• A towering mountain mass rising beyond the western treeline.
• Public/common name: Undergang Fjell
• Local/old-tongue rendering: Undergangsfjell (rarely written in full)
• Weather shifts fast here—bright one moment, slate-dark the next.
• The mountain is infamous for swallowing sound: wind dies, birds go quiet,
  and even footsteps feel muted on certain slopes.

Identity & Vibe:
- Not “demonic” — just old, heavy, and strangely watchful.
- Ominous grandeur: big skies, hard rock, long shadows, sudden fog walls.
- Feels like the world is holding its breath.

Key Features:
- The Shadow Face (the side visible from the Woods at dusk)
- Scree-Fields of Silence (loose stone slopes where sound seems to vanish)
- The Split Pass (a narrow saddle used for crossings and pilgrimages)
- Glacier-fed rills that feed the Woods’ rivers
- Windworn pillars (natural stone stacks that resemble ancient markers)

Band / Crew Hooks:
- Pilgrimage routes occasionally lead toward the Split Pass.
- The crew doesn’t “live” on the mountain—Undergang Fjell is a destination,
  a dare, a backdrop, a test.
- Locals joke: “Don’t translate the name unless you want it to feel real.”

============================================================
SOUTHERN REGION — (UNDEFINED YET)
============================================================
• Reserved for future lore.
• Could house plains cryptids, volcanic terrain, ancient ruins,
  or southern coastal villages depending on future development.

============================================================
ADDITIONAL FUTURE REGIONS
============================================================
• Northeastern Isles
• Frostback Mountains
• Moonwake Coast (southern warm region, if ever added)
• Hollowshade Marshlands
• STARFELL RIDGE (high-altitude cryptid territory)
• Your imagination will expand these over time.

============================================================
NOTES
============================================================
• Regions connected by river routes, forest paths, and old trade roads.
• The Northern Fringe is intentionally large — travel between
  regions takes days or weeks.
• The crew’s “default loop” when not recording/performing:
  sail the Fogwater Coast, then return inland to the Woods—
  and, when the mood turns cinematic, take the long road toward Undergang Fjell.
• Each mascot will eventually have a role both in the band and in
  the infrastructure of the Cryptid Quest website.
